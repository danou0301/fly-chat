# fly-chat

My first code on C# :)

Server-Client App !

A Chat App, you can chat and send files between clients, connected on the server.


----------------------------------------
# Default settings:
- Server on local ip: 127.0.0.1
- Server save files on its desktop
- User download files on "desktop/user" 


# To run:
1. Create a dir on the client desktop "/user"
2. Start the server
3. Start clients



# To Improve:
- Build a thread for client download file
- Add client name, to know who speak on the chat
- Show client connected number on the client app
- Display all files in the server even we start now the server


Enjoy :)
